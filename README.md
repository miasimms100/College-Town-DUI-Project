# College-Town-DUI-Project
This was a collaborative and culmalative project, completed in partnership with my programming team. 
The data set used covers the college town of Ames Iowa and their DUI stop records.
We explored the data and made changes to the data format prior to performing any analysis. 
We perform analysis looking at arrests at different times of day, per year, per month, etc. 
We created a few different types of plots and focused on their readiability through formatting changes.
We exported our results to a csv.
